          <h4>Affiliate Program Commissions Schedule</h4>
          <p>
            This Associates Program Advertising Fee Schedule (“Schedule”) is
            part of the Operating Agreement that governs your participation in
            the Associates Program. This Schedule describes the advertising fee
            rates you may earn as a participant in the Program. It also
            describes the limitations that apply to earning advertising fees on
            certain Products.
          </p>
          <p>
            From time to time, we may modify this Schedule in accordance with
            the Operating Agreement. All capitalized terms used below that are
            not defined on this page have the meanings given to them in the
            Operating Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            During each calendar month, you may earn advertising fees for
            Qualifying Purchases. Most advertising fees are calculated as a
            percentage of Qualifying Revenues based on the tables below and are
            subject to the limitations described in the “Limitations on
            Advertising Fee Rates for Certain Products” section below. We also
            may offer advertising fees in the form of bounties or other special
            offers as described in the “Special Offers and Promotions” section
            below. “Qualifying Revenues” mean amounts we receive from customers’
            Qualifying Purchases, excluding shipping, handling, and
            gift-wrapping fees, taxes, and service charges, and less any
            rebates, credit card processing fees, returns, and bad debt.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Program’s standard advertising fee structure is described in
            Table 1. The advertising fee rates you may earn will vary depending
            on the category of Products that are shipped, streamed, or
            downloaded (as applicable) in a given calendar month that constitute
            Qualifying Purchases. We will determine the classification of
            Products in each category set forth in Table 1 below or otherwise
            described on this page.
